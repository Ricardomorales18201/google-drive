**Assumptions and Design Decisions**__

Google Authentication: Google OAuth 2.0 is implemented to securely authenticate users.

Error Handling:

The app logs errors to the console for easy debugging.
A 403 error response (e.g., missing API key) prompts users to check authentication.
Browser Environment Check: The window object is accessed only in the browser environment using Angularâ€™s isPlatformBrowser, which is helpful for server-side rendering or test environments.

Styling: Tailwind CSS is used for responsive styling with accessibility in mind.

Standalone Components: Angular 18 standalone components simplify the app structure and reduce dependency on traditional modules.

Testing Framework: Cypress is chosen over Protractor for end-to-end testing due to its modern feature set and ease of integration.
